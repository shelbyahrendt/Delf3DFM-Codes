# Delf3DFM-Codes
Code to analyze Delft3D Flexible Mesh output.

This code is built to run off of a MATLAB (.m) file that contains Delft3D output. Files are still being updated.

### An example file workflow:
- 1. Convert MATLAB file to pickle file in Export_D3D_mat_as_pkl.ipynb
- 2. Plot spatial subsection around Everson Overflow in Plot_subsection_grid.ipynb
- 3. Extract results at evenly spaced transects along a channel centerline (input as .shp file). Pickle output.
- 4. Analyze transects: coming soon...
